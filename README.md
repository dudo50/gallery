# E.V.A. Gallery

Galleries have always occupied a significant position bridging artists and art enthusiasts.

The mission of `E.V.A. Gallery` is to redefine this dynamic through a universal digital platform. Here, artists can establish their own gallery spaces and exhibitions, while digital visitors can seamlessly explore them.

### Objectives:

1. Establish a singular, inclusive space where diverse artists can digitally showcase their work, while visitors can navigate through an array of digital galleries and exhibitions.
2. Integrate web3 NFTs into the platform, enabling the creation of hybrid digitalized and NFT exhibitions.
3. Enhance the platform with an AI assistant capable of guiding visitors in their search for art based on specific preferences and interests.
