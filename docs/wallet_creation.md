# Guide to Create a Wallet for Interaction with Your First NFT Assets üñºÔ∏è

  

A wallet is a tool that allows you to interact with Blockchain and sign transactions.

  

In the case of EVA Gallery, interaction with your wallet will be used to create new NFT assets and receive assets if you decide to try a free mint example.

  

There are multiple wallet providers for different blockchains. The blockchain that EVA Gallery is integrated with is Kusama. Kusama is a multichain network with great cross-chain capabilities, fast transaction processing times, and very cheap transaction fees. Creating an NFT asset on Kusama costs less than 1 cent!

  

## What is a Blockchain Wallet? üè¶

  

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage your cryptocurrency, including NFTs. It enables you to send, receive, and monitor your cryptocurrency balances. Unlike a traditional wallet that holds physical money, a blockchain wallet holds cryptographic information that allows you to access your digital assets on the blockchain.

  

### Key Features of a Blockchain Wallet üîë

  

1.  **Secure Access**: Wallets use cryptographic keys to secure your digital assets. You have a public key (like an account number) and a private key (like a password) that you must keep secret.

  

2.  **Ownership**: You control your assets without needing a third party, which is fundamental to decentralized finance.

  

3.  **Transaction Capability**: Wallets allow you to send and receive digital assets by signing transactions.

  

4.  **Compatibility**: Wallets can interact with different blockchains, supporting various cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
